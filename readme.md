## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
I created a multipage website to highlight the products and creation of the toy company I have choosen, namely Mofusand. By creating an about page, I highlighted their creations and features as a company, also creating a contact page allowing the viewers easy access to contact the company if needed. To showcase and buy the product a seperate page was created. Since this company is based from Japan, their information and assests were taken from Google.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project - a multi page website for a toy company.
- Whats the purpose - creating a multi-page website.
- What are key components - the landing of the website, about us page, highlights the featured products, displays products and contact page.
- What technology used and how it is used - Bootstrap was used to help build this website.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
